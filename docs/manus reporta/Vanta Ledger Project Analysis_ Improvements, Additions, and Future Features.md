This reduces development time and ensures a consistent user experience across devices, which is crucial for on-site data capture and mobile access [5].
*   **React for Web Frontend:** React is a leading JavaScript library for building dynamic and responsive user interfaces. Its component-based architecture facilitates modular UI development, and its ecosystem provides ample tools for building a comprehensive web dashboard [6].
*   **Docker Compose for Deployment:** The use of Docker Compose simplifies the deployment and management of the multi-service application. It ensures environment consistency, isolates services, and makes the entire stack portable, which is invaluable for self-hosted environments where manual setup can be complex [7].

**2.1.3. Modular Design and Clear Separation of Concerns:** The project exhibits a strong adherence to modular design principles. The backend is structured with distinct routers for `companies`, `projects`, `documents`, `ledger`, `users`, and `paperless`, indicating a clear separation of concerns. The planned AI/NLP microservice as a separate FastAPI application further exemplifies this, allowing independent scaling and updates of the NLP capabilities without affecting the main backend. This modularity enhances maintainability, testability, and allows for parallel development [8].

**2.1.4. Emphasis on Document Management:** The detailed plan for document ingestion, OCR, metadata extraction, and local file storage organization (`/docs/<company_name>/<project_name>/<year>_<doc_type>_<filename>_v<version>.pdf`) is a critical strength. Given the informal record-keeping practices mentioned, a robust and user-friendly document management system is paramount for the success of Vanta Ledger. The integration of Syncthing for seamless file transfer from various devices is also a thoughtful addition [9].
