# Vanta Ledger - Ultimate Vision (2024)

## Current State (June 2024)
- **Unified Notion-style Command Center UI**: All admin panels (Companies, Projects, Documents, Ledger, Subcontractors, Users) are scaffolded and integrated.
- **Analytics/Dashboard**: Summary widgets, charts, and key metrics panels (mock data).
- **Notifications/Alerts**: Centralized panel for system/user alerts (mock data).
- **AI/NLP Panel**: Document analysis, risk scoring, and semantic search (mock data).
- **Admin/Maintenance Tools**: System health, backup, and manual triggers (mock logic).
- **Security/User Management**: Advanced controls for roles, permissions, and audit logs (mock data).
- **Consistent black-and-white, high-contrast, modern UI**.
- **All panels are ready for backend integration and real-world workflow testing.**

## Next Phase Priorities
1. **Backend API Integration**
   - Connect all admin panels to real backend endpoints (CRUD for all entities).
   - Ensure real-time updates and error handling.
2. **Real Data Wiring**
   - Replace mock data with live data from the database and Paperless-ngx.
   - Integrate document status, analytics, and AI results.
3. **Advanced AI & Workflow Automation**
   - Enable live document analysis, risk scoring, and semantic search.
   - Automate routine workflows (e.g., compliance checks, notifications).
4. **User Testing & Feedback**
   - Conduct real-world user testing with the family business group.
   - Refine UI/UX and workflows based on feedback.
5. **Documentation & Training**
   - Complete user/admin documentation and onboarding guides.
   - Prepare training materials for all roles.

## Ready for: Backend integration, real data, and user-driven refinement.
