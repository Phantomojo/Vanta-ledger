    "text": "WORK METHODOLOGY\nINTRODUCTION \nThe following are the basic steps we intend to follow in the execution of works in the said project: \n\n Mobilization \nSetting Out \nSite Clearance \nCulvert and Drainage Works \nPassage of Traffic \nPaved Roads -Shoulder Maintenance and Repairs \nNatural Material Base and Sub Base \nCement and Lime Treated Sub Base and Base \nBituminous Surface Treatment and Surface Dressing \nBituminous Mixes \nConcrete Works (Culvert Works) \nRoad Furniture Repair and Maintenance \nCross Cutting Issues \nTraffic Management \nQuality Management Plan/Quality Control \nDemobilization \n\nMOBILIZATION. \nWe shall, upon being notified of the award and consequent order to commence the works, make necessary arrangements to provide the Performance Security and Insurances for works, plant/machinery and persons connected with the project. \nWe shall ensure the following: \nPlant and Personnel mobilization. \nConstruction of Contractor’s Camps. \nProcurement of Engineer’s Facilities. \nWe shall identify suitable sites to set up a quarry, material sites and camp site for the Site Agent and his site staff. The Contractor’s camp will accommodate the Site Agent’s offices, stores, workshop and plant/machinery. The Engineer’s representative will be facilitated by provision of offices, accommodation, vehicles, survey equipment, miscellaneous items and support staff. \nWe shall make good all access roads to Camp site and material sites. \nOnce setting up of the camp is completed, We shall mobilize relevant plant, machinery, materials and labour to site. Our personnel shall be induced to health & safety matters before works commence. A team shall be dispatched to erect publicity signs at locations directed by the Engineer. We will at this time stablish contacts with the Police and the local administration for provision of security. We shall proceed with the works, with due diligence, upon receiving the order to commence from the Engineer. \nSETTING OUT. \nThe first thing to be done will be to locate and check the control points both for alignment and heightening. We will then set out the road alignment. \nWe will locate all the traverse points, note their co-ordinates & heights and submit the survey data of such points for checking and approval by the Engineer. \nWe shall set out and monument the centre line of the road at Engineer’s recommended intervals before establishing the Original Ground Levels (OGLs). \nRoad cross-sections will also be taken and copies given to the Engineer. \nWe shall also use this time to acquaint himself with the existing service lines as well as structures. \nWe intends to use the available space (road reserve) and alignment with minimum disturbance to the existing buildings. \nSITE CLEARANCE. \nWe shall start clearing the site, remove trees, hedges etc immediately after setting out and taking of Original Ground Levels (OGLs). This activity shall also involve removal and reinstatement of hedges, structures and any other obstructions including cart to spoil as instructed by the Engineer. \nWe shall control dust pollution by watering the working area. \nWe intends to deploy adequate number of the following equipment for each of the earthworks team: \nClearing and Grubbing: - Graders. \n10m3Tipping Trucks. \n Wheel loader. \nEXCAVATION AND FILLING FOR STRUCTURES. \nWe shall excavate in any material for gabion works, river training works and other structures. \nWe shall provide and place gabion boxes and/or mattresses as scour protection as directed by the engineer or as specified. \nThe gabion boxes and mattresses shall be filled with rock and grouted as instructed by the Engineer. \nWhere instructed by the Engineer, We shall place gabions/rock fill behind structures as specified. \nWhere instructed by the Engineer, We shall provide all materials and construct stone pitching including grouting as specified. \nWhere instructed by the Engineer, We shall provide and install filter fabric for rock fill and sub soil drains as directed. \nWhenever instructed by the Engineer, We shall provide, place and compact selected fill material behind concrete walls. \nDRAINAGE & CULVERTS WORKS. \nWe shall ensure free flow conditions by excavating in any material for culverts, sub soil drains, side drains, mitre drains, catch-water drains and outfalls. We shall excavate, remove and dispose existing pipe culverts of any diameter including demolition of inlet/outlet. All pipe culverts instructed (900mm) by the Engineer as access or cross shall be constructed in good time to ensure that the finished pavement is well drained. All pipe culverts including surround, bed and wing walls shall be constructed by method of balloon or pre-cast pipe culverts and timber formwork casted in-situ. We shall provide all materials, form and construct reinforced concrete drain to Engineer’s details. \nWe shall provide all materials and construct all scour checks as directed by the Engineer. \nWe intends to deploy adequate number of the following equipment for drainage work: \n\n1No. Insitu Concrete Batch Mixer complete with automatic concrete mixing equipment and production capacity of 24m3/h. the machine to be within 30km from the Ports.  \n2No. Concrete Mixer Trucks with minimum capacity of 8m3 \n1No. Water Tanker minimum capacity of 5000 litres \nDumpers/ Shovel/ Bobcat\nExcavator 140HP or bigger\n140Hp Grader or bigger\nVibratory compactor/ Tandem Roller 145HP,10 Ton \nAir Compressor with 3 jacks \nTipper\nPneumatic Concrete pumping machine\nPoker/ Foam Vibrator \nSteel bar bender\n\nHeavy Grading and Compaction \nGrading covers the work involved in the reinstatement of the runaway to the camber by removing the high points and filling up gullies corrugations and wheel ruts to restore smooth running surface. \nThis activity shall consist of scarifying of the existing runway/carriageway surface, cutting high spots and moving materials to fill poholes, corrugations and wheel ruts and reshaping of the surface to the specified camber, using a motorized grader. All loose rocks, roots grasses shall be removed and disposed well clear of the drains. Pegs 300 to 400mm shall be placed at 10 to 20m intervals to mark edge of the carriageway. The material shall be bladed toward the center of the runway starting from both edges until the specified camber is achieved. \nGravelling \nGravelling consists of excavation, loading hauling and spreading of gravel wearing course material on the formation of runway. Gravel shall include lateritic gravel, quarzitic gravel, calcareous gravel, decomposed rock, soft stone coral rag, clayey sand and crushed rock. The material may be obtained from pits or excavation in cuttings. \nThe gravel shall be executed from quarries approved by the Engineer and it shall be tested for conformity with the required standards. This activity shall involve spreading the gravel material, shaping to ensure uniform thickness of the layer across the full width of the runway and to specified camber. Spreading will also include removing any oversized stones or boulders which cannot be broken down to required size, spoil dump. \nThe gravel wearing course material shall be deposited in such quantity and spread in a uniform layer across the full width. Every reasonable effort shall be made to prevent segregation during the loading, hauling, dumping, spreading, mixing, trimming and compacting operations. The compacted thickness of any layer laid, processed and compacted at one time shall not exceed 225mm and where a greater compacted thickness is required, the material shall be laid down and processed in two or more layers. The minimum layer thickness shall be 100mm. \nThe material shall be scarified and the moisture content adjusted by either uniformly mixing in water or drying out the material such that moisture content during compaction s between 80% and 105% of the optimum Moisture Content (AASHTO T180). It shall be graded and trimmed to final line and level. Light compaction may be applied before the final trim is carried out but once 25% of the compactive effort has been applied no further trimming or correction of surface will be done. The final trim shall be cut and we shall ensure that material from the trim is neither deposited in low areas nor spread across the section but graded clear of the works. \nPAVED ROADS -SHOULDER MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS \nShoulder construction would be carried out according to the designed cross sections and this work shall consist of excavation, backfilling and the provision of shoulder filter drain. Sample of soil would be taken from the locations approved by the Engineer and those samples would be placed in a bag providing identification tag. All required tests would be carried out in the materials testing laboratory according to the frequencies specified in the technical specification to confirm whether the material is suitable to be used as shoulder materials. Required test would be carried out after placing and compacting to check the degree of compaction. \nTo ensure that all activities being performed with the expected quality, an an inspection check list would be filled by the person in charge for the shoulder construction in case of preconstruction during construction. The inspection checklist shall include the specific requirements, safety and environmental measures. \nDimension Control \nShoulder construction would be carried out according to the designed cross sections.

It also \nrequires the directors to ensure that the company maintains proper accounting records which disclose, with reasonable accuracy, \nthe financial position of the company. The directors are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company.\nThe directors accept responsibility for the financial statements, which have been prepared using appropriate accounting policies \nsupported by reasonable and prudent judgements and estimates, in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards \nand the requirements of the Kenyan Companies Act. The directors are of the opinion that the financial statements give a true and \nfair view of the state of the financial affairs of the company as at 31st December 2022 and of its operating results for the year \nthen ended. The directors further accept responsibility for the maintenance of accounting records which have been relied upon in \nthe preparation of the financial statements, as well as on the adequacy of the systems of internal financial controls.\nNothing has come to the attention of the directors to indicate that the company will not remain a going concern for at least the \nnext twelve months from the date of this statement.\n3\nStatement of directors' responsibilities\nFor the year ended 31st December 2022\nSOLOPRIDE CONTRACTORS & GENERAL SUPPLIES LTD\nSusan Warigia Gitonga\n100\ni)  \nii)  \niii) \nwe have obtained all the information and explanations which to the best of our knowledge and belief were necessary \nfor the purposes of our audit;\nin our opinion, proper books of account have been kept by the company, so far as appears from our examination of \nthose books; and\nthe company's balance sheet and profit and loss account are in agreement with the books of account.\nPartner responsible for audit is CPA Daniel Dimba Oloo- Practising Certificate No. P/1978\n4\nMD Light and Associates\nCERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS\nREPORT OF THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS\nReport on the Financial Statements\n12 which comprise the balance sheet as at 31st December 2022, and the profit and loss account, statement of changes in \nequity and\ncash flow statement for the year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory \nnotes.\nDirectors' Responsibility for the Financial Statements\nThe directors are responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with \nInternational Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Kenyan Companies Act. This responsibility \nincludes: designing, implementing and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of \nfinancial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; selecting and applying \nappropriate accounting policies; and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.\nAuditor's Responsibility\nOur responsibility is to express an independent opinion of these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted \nour audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we comply with ethical \nrequirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free from \nmaterial misstatement.\nAn audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial \nstatements. The procedures selected depended on our professional judgement, including the assessment of the risks of \nmaterial misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, we \nconsidered the internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in \norder to design audit procedures that were appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an \nopinion on the company's internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies \nused and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the directors, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of \nthe financial statements. \nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.\nOpinion\nIn our opinion the accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of financial affairs of the \ncompany as at 31st December 2022 and of its profit and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with \nInternational Financial Reporting Standards and the Kenyan Companies Act.\nReport on Other Legal Requirements\nAs required by the Kenyan Companies Act we report to you, based on our audit, that:\nWe have audited the accompanying financial statements of Solopride Contractors & General Supplies Ltd, set out on pages 5 to \nTO THE MEMBERS OF SOLOPRIDE CONTRACTORS & GENERAL SUPPLIES LTD\n101\nNote\n2022\n2021\nKSHS\nKSHS\nBusiness Turnover\n41,234,538\n      \n31,718,875\n      \nLess: Cost of Sale\n4\n(30,925,903)\n    \n(23,789,156)\n    \n Gross Profit\n10,308,634\n      \n7,929,719\n        \nAdministration expenses\n5\n1,838,700\n        \n1,671,546\n        \nOther operating expenses\n6\n4,084,775\n        \n1,031,450\n        \nTotal Expenses\n5,923,475\n        \n2,702,996\n        \nOperating Profit\n4,385,159\n5,226,723\nPage 5\nFinancial statements\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022 \nSTATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nSOLOPRIDE CONTRACTORS & GENERAL SUPPLIES LTD\n102\nNOTE\n2022\n2021\nKSHS\nKSHS\n100,000\n \n100,000\n \nSCE\n17,597,509\n \n13,212,350\n           \n1,559,632\n \n1,559,632\n \n19,257,141\n \n14,871,982\n           \n7\n1,911,398\n \n2,017,081\n \nCURRENT ASSETS\nShortterm Investment\n4,463,030\n \nTrade and Other Receivables\n8\n12,851,492\n \n11,494,487\n           \nCash and Cash Equivalents\n2\n761,022\n \n1,744,344\n \n18,075,544\n \n13,238,831\n           \nCURRENT LIABILITIES\nTrade and Other Payables\n729,800\n \n383,930\n \n729,800\n \n383,930\n \nNET CURRENT ASSETS\n17,345,744\n \n12,854,901\n           \nTOTAL NET ASSETS\n19,257,141\n \n14,871,982\n           \nThe notes on pages 7 and 8 forms integral part of the Financial Statement \nThe Financial Statements were approved on -----------/--------/  2023\nDirector\nPage 6\nFinancial statements\nAs at 31st December 2022\nSTATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION\nFINANCED BY :\nShare capital Account\nAccumulated funds\nDirectors Account\nTotal\nNon Current Assets\nSOLOPRIDE CONTRACTORS & GENERAL SUPPLIES LTD\nSusan Warigia Gitonga\n103\nShare\nRetained\ncapital\nearnings\nTotal\nNote\nShs\nShs\nShs\n100,000\n     \n13,212,350\n      \n13,312,350\n      \n- \n- \n4,385,159\n        \n4,385,159\n        \nSTATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY\nAs At December 31,2020 \nShare Capital\nNet profit for the year\nAs At  December 31, 2022\n100,000\n17,597,509\n      \n17,697,509\nPage 7\nFinancial statements\nFor the year ended 31st December 2022\nSOLOPRIDE CONTRACTORS & GENERAL SUPPLIES LTD\n104\n2022\n2021\nKSHS\nKSHS\n4,385,159\n     \n5,226,723\n    \n105,683\n        \n141,367\n       \n4,490,842\n     \n5,368,089\n    \n345,870\n        \n4,565\n \n(1,357,005)\n    \n(3,922,852)\n  \n- \n- \n3,479,708\n     \n1,449,802\n    \n3,479,708\n     \n1,449,802\n    \n(4,463,030)\n    \n(4,463,030)\n    \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n(983,322)\n       \n1,449,802\n    \n1,744,344\n     \n294,542\n       \n761,022\n        \n1,744,344\n    \n-0\n0\npage 8\nFinancial Statements\nAs at 31st December 2022\nSTATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nNet Profit before taxation \nAdjustments for :\nDepreciation\nOperating profit before working capital changes\nIncrease  ( Decrease ) in Trade Payables\nDecrease  ( Increase ) in Trade Receivables \nDecrease  ( Increase ) in Closing Stock\nCash generated from operations\nNet Cash from( used in ) Operating Activities \nCash flows from Investing Activities\nAcquisition of Assets\nNet Cash used in Investing Activities\nCash flows from Financing Activities\nNet Cash from (used in )Financing Activities \nNet Increase / ( Decrease ) in Cash flows\nCash and  Cash Equivalents : Beginning\nCash and  Cash Equivalents : Ending - Note 2\nSOLOPRIDE CONTRACTORS & GENERAL SUPPLIES LTD\n105\nFurniture and Fittings\n12.5%\n12.5%\nMotor vehicles\n25.0%\n25.0%\nLand and building\n0.0%\n0.0%\n( c ) Turnover\nRevenue is recognised when a cash sale is raised.\n2.

In preparing those financial statement,\nthe directors are required to:\na)  Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;\nb)  Make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;\nc)  State whether applicable accounting standards have been followed; \nd) Prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to\n     presume that the company will continue with its operations.\nThe directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with\nreasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and to enable them to\nensure that the financial statements comply with the companies Act. They are also responsible \nfor safeguarding the assets of the company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the\nprevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.\nDIRECTOR\nPage 4\nAltan Enterprises Limited\nFinancial Statements\nFor the Period Ended 31st December 2019\nREPORT OF THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS TO THE MEMBERS OF ALTAN ENTERPRISES LIMITED\nWe have audited the financial statements set on page 7 to 16. We have obtained all the\ninformation and explanations which to the best of our knowledge and belief were necessary for the\npurposes of our audit. The financial statements are in agreement with the books of account.\nRespective responsibilities of directors and auditors\nThe directors are responsible for the preparation of financial statements which give a true and fair \nview of the company's state of affairs and its profit or loss. Our responsibility is to express an \nindependent opinion on the financial statements based on our audit and to report our opinion to you.\nBasis of opinion\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the International Standards on Auditing. Those standards\nrequire that we plan and perform our audit to obtain reasonable assurance that the  financial\nstatements are free from material misstatement. An audit includes an examination, on a test basis,\nof evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.

    "text": "WORK METHODOLOGY FOR\n INTRODUCTION \nThe following are the basic steps we intend to follow in the execution of works in the said project: \n Mobilization \nSetting Out \nSite Clearance \nCulvert and Drainage Works \nPassage of Traffic \nPaved Roads -Shoulder Maintenance and Repairs \nNatural Material Base and Sub Base \nCement and Lime Treated Sub Base and Base \nBituminous Surface Treatment and Surface Dressing \nBituminous Mixes \nConcrete Works (Culvert Works) \nRoad Furniture Repair and Maintenance \nCross Cutting Issues \nTraffic Management \nQuality Management Plan/Quality Control \nDemobilization \nMOBILIZATION. \nWe shall, upon being notified of the award and consequent order to commence the works, make necessary arrangements to provide the Performance Security and Insurances for works, plant/machinery and persons connected with the project. \nWe shall ensure the following: \nPlant and Personnel mobilization. \nConstruction of Contractor’s Camps. \nProcurement of Engineer’s Facilities. \nWe shall identify suitable sites to set up a quarry, material sites and camp site for the Site Agent and his site staff. The Contractor’s camp will accommodate the Site Agent’s offices, stores, workshop and plant/machinery. The Engineer’s representative will be facilitated by provision of offices, accommodation, vehicles, survey equipment, miscellaneous items and support staff. \nWe shall make good all access roads to Camp site and material sites. \nOnce setting up of the camp is completed, We shall mobilize relevant plant, machinery, materials and labour to site. Our personnel shall be induced to health & safety matters before works commence. \nA team shall be dispatched to erect publicity signs at locations directed by the Engineer. We will at this time establish contacts with the Police and the local administration for provision of security. We shall proceed with the works, with due diligence, upon receiving the order to commence from the Engineer. \nSETTING OUT. \nThe first thing to be done will be to locate and check the control points both for alignment and heightening. We will then set out the road alignment. \nWe will locate all the traverse points, note their co-ordinates & heights and submit the survey data of such points for checking and approval by the Engineer. \nWe shall set out and monument the centre line of the road at Engineer’s recommended intervals before establishing the Original Ground Levels (OGLs). \nRoad cross-sections will also be taken and copies given to the Engineer. \nWe shall also use this time to acquaint himself with the existing service lines as well as structures. \nWe intends to use the available space (road reserve) and alignment with minimum disturbance to the existing buildings. \nSITE CLEARANCE. \nWe shall start clearing the site, remove trees, hedges etc immediately after setting out and taking of Original Ground Levels (OGLs). This activity shall also involve removal and reinstatement of hedges, structures and any other obstructions including cart to spoil as instructed by the Engineer. \nWe shall control dust pollution by watering the working area. \nWe intends to deploy adequate number of the following equipment for each of the earthworks team: \nClearing and Grubbing: - Graders. \n10m3Tipping Trucks. \n Wheel loader. \nEXCAVATION AND FILLING FOR STRUCTURES. \nWe shall excavate in any material for gabion works, river training works and other structures. \nWe shall provide and place gabion boxes and/or mattresses as scour protection as directed by the engineer or as specified. \nThe gabion boxes and mattresses shall be filled with rock and grouted as instructed by the Engineer. \nWhere instructed by the Engineer, We shall place gabions/rock fill behind structures as specified. \nWhere instructed by the Engineer, We shall provide all materials and construct stone pitching including grouting as specified. \nWhere instructed by the Engineer, We shall provide and install filter fabric for rock fill and sub soil drains as directed. \nWhenever instructed by the Engineer, We shall provide, place and compact selected fill material behind concrete walls. \nDRAINAGE & CULVERTS WORKS. \nWe shall ensure free flow conditions by excavating in any material for culverts, sub soil drains, side drains, mitre drains, catch-water drains and outfalls. We shall excavate, remove and dispose existing pipe culverts of any diameter including demolition of inlet/outlet. All pipe culverts instructed (900mm) by the Engineer as access or cross shall be constructed in good time to ensure that the finished pavement is well drained. All pipe culverts including surround, bed and wing walls shall be constructed by method of balloon or pre-cast pipe culverts and timber formwork casted in-situ. We shall provide all materials, form and construct reinforced concrete drain to Engineer’s details. \nWe shall provide all materials and construct all scour checks as directed by the Engineer. \nWe intends to deploy adequate number of the following equipment for drainage work: \n1No. Insitu Concrete Batch Mixer complete with automatic concrete mixing equipment and production capacity of 24m3/h. the machine to be within 30km from the Ports.  \n2No. Concrete Mixer Trucks with minimum capacity of 8m3 \n1No. Water Tanker minimum capacity of 5000 litres \nDumpers/ Shovel/ Bobcat\nExcavator 140HP or bigger\n140Hp Grader or bigger\nVibratory compactor/ Tandem Roller 145HP,10 Ton \nAir Compressor with 3 jacks \nTipper\nPneumatic Concrete pumping machine\nPoker/ Foam Vibrator \nSteel bar bender\nHeavy Grading and Compaction \nGrading covers the work involved in the reinstatement of the runaway to the camber by removing the high points and filling up gullies corrugations and wheel ruts to restore smooth running surface. \nThis activity shall consist of scarifying of the existing runway/carriageway surface, cutting high spots and moving materials to fill poholes, corrugations and wheel ruts and reshaping of the surface to the specified camber, using a motorized grader. All loose rocks, roots grasses shall be removed and disposed well clear of the drains. Pegs 300 to 400mm shall be placed at 10 to 20m intervals to mark edge of the carriageway. The material shall be bladed toward the center of the runway starting from both edges until the specified camber is achieved. \nGravelling \nGravelling consists of excavation, loading hauling and spreading of gravel wearing course material on the formation of runway. Gravel shall include lateritic gravel, quarzitic gravel, calcareous gravel, decomposed rock, soft stone coral rag, clayey sand and crushed rock. The material may be obtained from pits or excavation in cuttings. \nThe gravel shall be executed from quarries approved by the Engineer and it shall be tested for conformity with the required standards. This activity shall involve spreading the gravel material, shaping to ensure uniform thickness of the layer across the full width of the runway and to specified camber. Spreading will also include removing any oversized stones or boulders which cannot be broken down to required size, spoil dump. \nThe gravel wearing course material shall be deposited in such quantity and spread in a uniform layer across the full width. Every reasonable effort shall be made to prevent segregation during the loading, hauling, dumping, spreading, mixing, trimming and compacting operations. The compacted thickness of any layer laid, processed and compacted at one time shall not exceed 225mm and where a greater compacted thickness is required, the material shall be laid down and processed in two or more layers. The minimum layer thickness shall be 100mm. \nThe material shall be scarified and the moisture content adjusted by either uniformly mixing in water or drying out the material such that moisture content during compaction s between 80% and 105% of the optimum Moisture Content (AASHTO T180). It shall be graded and trimmed to final line and level. Light compaction may be applied before the final trim is carried out but once 25% of the compactive effort has been applied no further trimming or correction of surface will be done. The final trim shall be cut and we shall ensure that material from the trim is neither deposited in low areas nor spread across the section but graded clear of the works. \nPAVED ROADS -SHOULDER MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS \nShoulder construction would be carried out according to the designed cross sections and this work shall consist of excavation, backfilling and the provision of shoulder filter drain.

In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal controls relevant to \nthe company's preparation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are \nappropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the \neffectiveness of the company's internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the\n appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates \nmade by the directors, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. \nOpinion\nIn our opinion the accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of \nfinancial affairs of the company as at 31st December 2020 and of its financial performance and \ncash flows for the period then ended in accordance with the International Financial Reporting \nStandards and the Kenyan Companies Act.\nHIRAM &TAM

Mobilization and site set up\nIn case we are awarded the contract, proper arrangements will be put in place to ensure that all the necessary plant and equipment are brought to site in good time. The equipment will be made sure are in good working conditions and will be properly maintained throughout the entire contract period.\nAwareness will be created to let the locals know about the project and publicity signs will be put in place with the relevant details.\nHaving achieved the above, we shall commence the works upon approval by the Engineer.\nWe shall put in place a work program with all the activities and their stipulated timelines.\n2. Traffic control \nSince the road is being in use, a proper guideline will be put in place to ensure smooth running of traffic. A proper traffic management system will be put in place to ensure that activities taking place cause minimum traffic interruption. Deviations will be created where necessary and all directions will be properly marked so as to make it easier for other road users during the entire contract period. Minimum appropriate speed will be maintained so as to avoid accidents in the course of the works. Warning signs will also be put in place to control the road users. Where necessary, we shall put flagmen on the ground to control the traffic. A proper maintenance plan will be put in place to ensure that the deviations are in good shape at all times.\n\n\n\n3. Site Clearance \n Site clearance will be done manually or mechanically as necessary and cleared material shall be collected and disposed of off-site as directed by the Engineer.\nMethod\n- Set out the area to be cleared.\n- Place the workers in such a way that they know which area to clear and that they have sufficient working space.\n- Issue the necessary tools and start the work.\n- Throw the bushes outside the cleared area or heap them in the middle of the clearing where they can be burned afterwards.\nTools\t\nFor excavation: hoes, mattocks and shovels.\nFor cutting: axes, mattocks, bow-saws.\nOther: ropes, winch, hand tong, grapple\n4. Material Sourcing And Testing\nAs specified in the tender documents, materials shall be sourced and before being used on. Sand shall be of the best quality with the approved grading.\nGravel samples will be taken to the laboratory for testing before being ferried to site. The gravel will be subjected to all the necessary tests to ensure that the best results are obtained.\nConcrete shall also be subjected to testing for the maximum strength.\nTippers will be used to transport the materials to site and proper arrangements will be put in place to ensure that the materials are brought to site in good time to avoid delays.\n\n\n\n\n5. Grading And Gravelling\nPreparation patching of large potholes or depressions should be carried out in advance of the grading. Areas of standing water should be drained. This preparation will ease the work and make the resulting surface last longer. Scarifying may be necessary to scarify the existing surface to cut to the bottom of any surface defects and loosen the material for reshaping.  \nMachine Attendants help direct traffic and grader turning, and remove large stones and other unwanted material from the path of the grader. The grader works on one side of the road at a time and works in passes about 200 metres long to convenient and safe turning points. \nGravel for patching should be stockpiled at the quarry or maintenance camp, or dumped at the side of the road near where it will be used (so that it does not block the road or drainage system). The gravel must be at least as good a quality as the material already surfacing the road. Its use must be approved by the Materials Engineer and must meet the specifications.\nGravelling is normally carried out with one layer 15 cm thickness. Usually a continuous layer of gravel is laid on the existing running surface, however on some occasions only short stretches showing severe defects are covered under a spot re-gravelling operation.\nSite Preparation Wherever possible, before the gravelling work starts, the grader should open a diversion adjacent to the road. If traffic is diverted from the work site, it will enable the job to be carried out more efficiently and safely.\n6. Quality control\nAs specified in the bill of the quantities, we shall provide qualified and experienced personnel who shall be on site at all times to ensure that the works are done properly and in the right procedure. Our team will work hand in hand with the supervisory team to ensure that the project runs smoothly. Materials shall be tested before delivery to site. All our borrow pits shall be tested. Mix designs for our concrete shall be done by our team with the supervision of the Engineer. All machines shall be properly maintained and ensured they are in good working conditions.\n7. Security\nA site lay out plan will be put in place to ensure the safety of all the plant and equipment, materials and any other thing that shall be on site.  We shall establish a good working relationship with the local administration and the people to ensure that the security of the workers, material and equipment is observed. Security guards shall always be on site to monitor the daily movements in and out of site.\nThe workers shall be provided with all the necessary gear to ensure their safety is observed. This will include helmets, reflective gear, safety boots and any other necessary safety gadget. A fully equipped first aid kit will always be availed onsite to take care of small accidents. Workers shall be taken through a drill to make them aware of the things to observe to avoid accidents and get the best results.\n9.
