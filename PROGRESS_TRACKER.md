- Project has solid foundation but needs systematic cleanup
- Testing infrastructure is the biggest risk
- Security issues are manageable but need immediate attention

### **Lessons Learned**
- Comprehensive planning upfront saves time later
- Testing should be prioritized over new features
- Security should be built-in, not bolted-on

### **Next Steps**
1. Begin test infrastructure diagnosis
2. Set up proper development environment
3. Start systematic cleanup of debug code
