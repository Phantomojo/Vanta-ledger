# Vanta Ledger Security Enhancement Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive security enhancements implemented to address the critical vulnerabilities identified in the security audit. All changes follow security best practices and industry standards.

## Critical Security Issues Addressed

### 1. Authentication and Authorization

  # Security Headers
  ENABLE_HSTS: bool = True
  ENABLE_CSP: bool = True
  ```

### 5. Dependencies and Package Security

#### ✅ **UPDATED: Secure Dependencies**
- **Implementation**: Updated `backend/requirements-hybrid.txt`
- **New Security Packages**:
  ```txt
  # Security and validation
  python-magic==0.4.27          # File type validation
  python-magic-bin==0.4.14      # Windows support
