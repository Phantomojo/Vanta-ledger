## 🔑 Environment Variables

All credentials are now stored in the `.env` file. To set up:

1. **Generate secure passwords:**
   ```bash
   ./generate-secure-passwords.sh
   ```

2. **Review the generated .env file:**
   ```bash
   cat .env
   ```

3. **Apply security updates:**
   ```bash
   ./security-update.sh
   ```
